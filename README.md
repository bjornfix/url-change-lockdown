## What It Does

Freezes existing post and taxonomy slugs unless explicitly unlocked.

This is a small WordPress maintenance plugin built for a specific operational problem. It stays focused so the behavior is easy to understand, verify, and keep enabled.

**Example:** "Protect this site from the maintenance issue this plugin handles." - Install the plugin, verify the expected behavior, and let it keep doing that one job.

## The Real Workflow

In practice, the useful path is simple:

1. install and activate the plugin
2. leave existing slugs locked by default
3. use the documented allow constant only when a rename is intentional
4. verify established URLs after imports or programmatic updates

The human's job is to decide whether the behavior fits the site.
The plugin's job is to apply that behavior consistently.

## Why This Feels Different

Most small WordPress maintenance problems get handled manually or with broad plugins that do more than needed.

This plugin is different because it keeps a narrow scope:

- one clear purpose
- predictable behavior
- normal WordPress installation and update flow
- public source and release history

That changes the experience from:

- `Remember to handle this manually every time`

to:

- `Install the focused plugin and verify the result`

## Before vs After

### Before

- the issue depends on manual attention
- behavior can drift between maintenance runs
- fixes are easy to forget when work is repetitive

### After

- the site has a focused plugin for the job
- behavior is consistent between maintenance runs
- releases and source are easy to inspect

## Who It Is For

This is a good fit for:

- WordPress site owners with the specific maintenance problem this plugin solves
- agencies maintaining many WordPress sites
- operators who prefer focused plugins over broad toolkits
- teams that want public source and release notes before installing a plugin

## Documentation

Start with the public plugin page:

- [Plugin Page](https://devenia.com/plugins/url-change-lockdown/)

## Start Here

If you are new to the plugin, use this order:

1. Read the plugin page
2. Download the latest release
3. Install it on WordPress
4. Verify the expected behavior
5. Keep it active if the behavior matches the site

## Behavior

- Freezes existing post slugs (`post_name`) on programmatic update unless explicitly unlocked
- Freezes existing taxonomy term slugs on programmatic update unless explicitly unlocked
- Allows authorized human edits from the WordPress admin/editor UI
- Does not lock links inside post content
- Does not lock post meta values
- Supports temporary allow constants when you intentionally need to rename slugs

## Changelog

### 1.4.3
- Fixed manual editing: authorized wp-admin/editor requests can now intentionally change post and term slugs
- Programmatic writes without a verified admin/editor context remain locked unless explicitly allowed

### 1.4.2
- Docs: expanded the WordPress-standard `readme.txt` so the published ZIP now includes fuller behavior, installation, use-case, and Devenia link sections

### 1.4.1
- Clarified behavior: existing slugs are frozen across update paths unless explicitly unlocked
- Moved slug guards to late filter priority to prevent downstream filter overrides
- Documentation now explicitly states that post-content URLs are not locked

### 1.4.0
- Scope clarified and enforced as slug-only protection
- Removed content URL, metadata URL, and option/permalink guards
- Keeps post and taxonomy slug locks in place for programmatic updates

### 1.3.0
- Hardened lock scope to deny URL mutations by default across content, meta/custom fields, term URL drivers, and URL settings
- Removed REST/header-based manual allowance from the URL lock path to prevent API bypasses
- Kept non-URL content edits allowed to preserve URL-only scope

### 1.2.0
- Hardened REST/manual detection by requiring a wp-admin referer in addition to REST nonce
- Added URL-diff locking for `post_content` and `post_excerpt` to block programmatic link changes

### 1.1.2
- Readme tag cleanup (WordPress.org limit)

### 1.1.1
- Allow manual bulk edits via wp-admin without triggering URL locks

### 1.1.0
- Block programmatic changes to slugs, parent pages, taxonomies, and permalink settings

### 1.0.0
- Initial release
